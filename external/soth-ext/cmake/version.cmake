# .. command:: VERSION_COMPUTE
#
#  Deduce automatically the version number.
#  This mechanism makes sure that version number is always up-to-date and
#  coherent (i.e. strictly increasing as commits are made).
#
#  There is two cases:
#
#  - the software comes from a release (stable version). In this case, the
#    software is retrieved through a tarball which does not contain the ``.git``
#    directory. Hence, there is no way to search in the Git history to generate
#    the version number.
#    In this case, a ``.version`` file is put at the top-directory of the source
#    tree which contains the project version. Read the file to retrieve the
#    version number.
#
#  - the softwares comes from git (possibly unstable version).
#    ``git describe`` is used to retrieve the version number
#    (see 'man git-describe'). This tool generates a version number from the git
#    history. The version number follows this pattern:
#
#      ``TAG[-N-SHA1][-dirty]``
#
#    - ``TAG``: last matching tag (i.e. last signed tag starting with v, i.e. v0.1)
#    - ``N``: number of commits since the last maching tag
#    - ``SHA1``: sha1 of the current commit
#    - ``-dirty``: added if the workig directory is dirty (there is some uncommitted
#      changes).
#
#    For stable releases, i.e. the current commit is a matching tag, ``-N-SHA1`` is
#    omitted. If the HEAD is on the signed tag v0.1, the version number will be
#    0.1.
#
#    If the HEAD is two commits after v0.5 and the last commit is 034f6d...
#    The version number will be:
#
#    - ``0.5-2-034f`` if there is no uncommitted changes,
#    - ``0.5-2-034f-dirty`` if there is some uncommitted changes.
