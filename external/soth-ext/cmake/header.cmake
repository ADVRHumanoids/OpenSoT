#
#     List of C++ header filenames. They will be installed automatically
#     using :command:`HEADER_INSTALL`
#

#   .. command:: _SETUP_PROJECT_HEADER
#
#     This setup CMake to handle headers properly.
#
#     1. The `include` directory in the build and source trees is added
#        to the include search path (see INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES).
#        As always, the build directory has the priority over the source
#        directory in case of conflict.
#
#        However you *should not* have conflicting names
#        for files which are both in the build and source trees.
#        Conflicting names are filenames which differ only by a prefix:
#
#        include/a.h vs _build/include/a.h
#        src/a.h     vs src/foo/a.h
#
#        ...this files makes a project very fragile as the -I ordering
#        will have a lot of importance and may break easily when using
#        tools which may reorder the pre-processor flags such as pkg-config.
#
#
#     2. The headers are installed in the prefix
#        in a way which preserves the directory structure.
#
#        The directory name for header follows the rule:
#        each non alpha-numeric character is replaced by a slash (`/`).
#        In practice, it means that hpp-util will put its header in:
#        ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/hpp/util
#
#        This rule has been decided to homogenize headers location, however
#        some packages do not follow this rule (dg-middleware for instance).
#
#        In that case, CUSTOM_HEADER_DIR can be set to override this policy.
#
#        Reminder: breaking the JRL/LAAS policies shoud be done after
#                  discussing the issue. You should at least open a ticket
#                  or send an e-mail to notify this behavior.
