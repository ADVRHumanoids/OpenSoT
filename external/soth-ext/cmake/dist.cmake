# .. command:: _SETUP_PROJECT_DIST
#
#   .. _target-dist:
#
#   Add a *dist* target to generate a tarball using ``git-archive``.
#
#   Linux specific: use ``git-archive-all.sh`` to obtain a recursive
#   ``git-archive`` on the project's submodule.
#   Please note that ``git-archive-all.sh`` is not carefully written
#   and create a temporary file in the source directory
#   (which is then moved to the build directory).
