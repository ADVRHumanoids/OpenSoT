==========
The **OpenSoT** project was initiated in February 2014 as a versatile inverse kinematics solver for floating-base systems, initially for participation in the Darpa Robotics Challenge (DRC). This library was conceived and developed as part of the `WALK-MAN EU Project <https://walk-man.eu/>`_ at the Italian Institute of Technology.

In 2017, the European Union acknowledged **OpenSoT** as a EU Funded Innovation under the category `DEEP TECH INNOVATION <https://innovation-radar.ec.europa.eu/innovation/30633>`_.

Subsequently, the evolution of **OpenSoT** has primarily been driven by the EU projects `CENTAURO <https://www.centauro-project.eu/>`_ and `COGIMON <https://cogimon.eu/>`_.
