Welcome to OpenSoT's documentation!
===================================
**OpenSoT** is a C++ library designed to streamline the process of writing and solving Quadratic and Linear Programming (QP/LP) problems with a focus on robotic applications, such as Differential Inverse Kinematics (DIK), Inverse Dynamics (ID), and contact force distribution.
**OpenSoT** provides interfaces for <span style="color:green">*Tasks*</span> and <span style="color:red">*Constraints*</span>, transforming them into atomic entities that can be seamlessly combined to create complex control problems, all of which can be efficiently solved using dedicated *Solvers*.
