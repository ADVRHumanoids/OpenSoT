- Many Bug Fixes
- Improved documentation (we hope!)

An Open Source Task Solving library with Constraints

Introduction
------------
OpenSoT is a library dedicated to hierarchical whole-body control of robots subject to constraints such as joint limits, joint velocities, cartesian constraints... The main idea behind OpenSoT is to decouple Task and Constraints description from the Solver used to compute the robot commands and the Type of Control available on the robot to perform them.

OpenSoT is developed under the European Project WALK-MAN: http://www.walk-man.eu/.

Its homepage resides in http://github.com/robotology-playground/OpenSoT
You can also find a wiki there.

An online version of this documentation can be obtained in http://opensot.github.io
