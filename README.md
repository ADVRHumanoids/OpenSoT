OpenSoT Lite (v2.0)
============
New version of OpenSoT based mainly on Eigen3.0.
Most of the code has been ported to Eigen to be real time safe. The Lite version represent a working progress in which we want to try to achieve real time performances where is possible. 

An Open Source Task Solving library with Constraints

Available Solvers:
------------------
- iHQP: implemented using qpOASES (https://projects.coin-or.org/qpOASES) or osqp (http://osqp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- eHQP: implemented using Eigen-based Damped Pseudo Inverse

The default iHQP solver is based on qpOASES. 

Introduction
------------
OpenSoT is a library dedicated to hierarchical whole-body control of robots subject to constraints such as joint limits, joint velocities, cartesian constraints... The main idea behind OpenSoT is to decouple Task and Constraints description from the Solver used to compute the robot commands and the Type of Control available on the robot to perform them.

OpenSoT was initially developed under the EU Project WALK-MAN (http://www.walk-man.eu/).
At the moment the project is developed under the EU Projects CogIMon (https://cogimon.eu/) and CENTAURO (http://www.centauro-project.eu/). 

Its homepage resides in http://github.com/robotology-playground/OpenSoT
You can also find a wiki there.
