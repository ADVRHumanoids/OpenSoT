OpenSoT  ![Travis badge](https://app.travis-ci.com/ADVRHumanoids/OpenSoT.svg?token=iQZzUD6rXcPydQAabf7T&branch=devel)
============
OpenSoT is a library dedicated to hierarchical whole-body control of robots subject to linear constraints. 

OpenSoT was initially developed under the EU Project WALK-MAN (http://www.walk-man.eu/).
Its development continued under the EU Projects CogIMon (https://cogimon.eu/) and CENTAURO (http://www.centauro-project.eu/).
