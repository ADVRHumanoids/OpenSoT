             * In OpenSoT, all the considered Hessians \f$H\f$ are in particular Hermitians and positive semidefinite/definite.
             * Let consider two matrices \f$A\f$ and \f$B\f$ with Hessians \f$H_A = A^TA\f$ and \f$H_B=B^TB\f$, the Aggregated Task
             * \f$C\f$ is computed as:
             * \f$
             *   \begin{equation}
             *     C = \left[A^T \quad B^T\right]^T
             *   \end{equation}
             * \f$
             * and the associated Hessian \f$H_C\f$ is computed as:
             * \f$
             *   \begin{equation}
             *     H_C = \left[A^T \quad B^T\right]\left[A^T \quad B^T\right]^T \\
             *         = A^TA + B^TB = H_A + H_B
             *   \end{equation}
             * \f$
             * In general for an arbitrary number of tasks we can say \f$H_{Agg} = \displaystyle\sum_{i}^{n} H_i\f$. Therefore the problem of
             * determine the new Hessian type for the Aggregated Task can be considered as the problem to determine the Hessian type of the
             * sum of different matrices with known Hessian type.
             * Observation: The sum of any two positive definite matrices of the same size is positive definite. More generally, any
             * nonnegative linear combination of positive semidefinite matrices is positive semidefinite (Roger A. Horn and Charles R. Johnson,
             * Matrix Analysis, Cambridge University Press, 1996, p.398).
             * With these considerations in mind, the method will return:
             *      HST_UNKNOWN if at least one of the Hessians in HST_UNKNOWN
             *      HST_ZERO if all the Hessians are HST_ZERO
             *      HST_POSDEF if at least one Hessian is HST_POSDEF (and none HST_UNKNOWN)
             *      HST_SEMIDEF if all one Hessian is HST_SEMIDEF (and none HST_UNKNOWN)
             *
             * TO DO: Take in consideration also \f$\beta\f$ and \f$\W\f$!
