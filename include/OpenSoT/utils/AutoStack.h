     * @brief The AutoStack class eases the managing of a stack of task,
     *        by automatically calling the update() function on all
     *        tasks of the stack. Many operators are defined for the
     *        AutoStack, so that it's possible to concisely write
     *        stacks. Together with OpenSoT::DefaultHumanoidStack
     *        it allows to use the MOT (Math of Tasks) to define stacks, e.g.:
     * AutoStack = (T1 + T2) / (T3 << ConstraintT3 + T4) << Bounds
     *
     * You can see an example in @ref example_autostack.cpp
